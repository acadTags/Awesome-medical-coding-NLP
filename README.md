# Awesome-medical-coding-NLP
 Automated medical coding is an area in Clinical Natural Language Processing to assign diagnosis or procedure medical codes to free-text clinical notes. The domain is a sub-field of document classification and information extraction.

 Below is a curation of papers in this field. Given the many new papers published, I may have lost some of them.
